// Post-build: emit a real static HTML file per client-side route so GitHub Pages
// serves each with HTTP 200 (not the 404.html fallback), AND bake unique SEO
// meta (title, description, canonical, og/twitter) into each one so crawlers and
// social scrapers see the right tags without executing JS.
//
// For every route we emit BOTH forms so either URL returns 200 with no redirect:
//   dist/about.html          -> served for /about   (clean URL, no trailing slash)
//   dist/about/index.html    -> served for /about/  (trailing slash)
// Plus dist/404.html as the SPA fallback for any genuinely unknown path.
//
// Keep ROUTES in sync with the <case "/x"> routes in src/App.tsx. Titles are
// under 60 chars, descriptions 150-160, and every title contains "EARNWINGS".
